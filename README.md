# Marketing_Analysis

Hi, my name is Jaswanth Kantipudi and this is a Marketing Analysis project that I did focusing on customer segmentation through data processing, data visualization, and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 

Marketing is one of the most essential parts of running a successful company which is why it requires an enormous amount of time and money. The importance of marketing can often be overlooked but it can truly make or break an entire company. As the economy gets more complex and society continues to evolve, it can be difficult to put out impactful marketing campaigns without understanding the customer base a company has. The most important objective of this project was to use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to break down the entire existing customer base into meaningful clusters or segments that make it much easier to understand the customer base as a whole.
